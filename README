Description
-----------
This is a small programm to display some information you need to be notified
about. It also monitors you volume and shows it. You can use DBus or a TCP
connection to show text or a progress bar.

Requirements
------------
You need the following packages to be installed.
- Qt >=4.4 (http://www.trolltech.com)
- ALSA (http://www.alsa-project.org/)

Install
-------
Just do a "qmake && make" and copy the binary "qtosd" somewhere to your path.

Configuration & usage
---------------------
There are some parameters you can use:

 -n 			Don't start in daemon mode
 -p port 		Port for TCP server (p == 0 disables TCP server)
 -b background.svg 	Imagefile for background
 -h 			Show a brief help

The text you send can also have a special format:

some text
  -> shows just "some text"

c/some text
  -> clears the display before showing this text. (usefull for toggling options)

10/100 some text
  -> shows a progress bar and use 10 as value, 100 as max and "some text".

Have also a look at the examples.

Background
----------
For the background you have to use a SVG file. Just create it with a size ratio
of 800:150 (pixels). To use translucency you need a compositing window manager
or you have to use xcompmgr.

Have fun ;)
